# Todolist_Application


<h2> SOME APP SCREEN </h2>

<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
This is a Single Page Application. There is only one mainActivity and two fragment i.e. TODOLIST fragment and TODOADD fragment. Fragment is attached in center of the screen using Frame layout and it is replaced by the Fragment manager and only center of the screen changes. 

At First, TODOLIST fragment is added in the middle by Fragmentmanager and then after clicking on the add button below it is replaced.

There is no task at first as showing in the below images:

<img src="images/no_data.jpg" alt="no_data_image" height="400px" width="200px" />     <img src="images/no_data.gif" alt="no_data_image" height="400px" width="200px" /> 

After clicking in the plus button, Frame layout is replaced using Fragment manager and we can see the only center view is changed and we are in the TODOADD fragment. 

Task can be added in the following ways as shown in image below:

<img src="images/add_task.jpg" alt="ADD TASK IMAGE" height="400px" width="200px" />     <img src="images/add_task.gif" alt="ADD TASK GIF" height="400px" width="200px" />
